Cloud computing: The delivery of a shared pool of on-demand computing services over the public internet,
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

5 Characteristics of Cloud
1. On-demand Self-Service: Provision resources automatically without requiring human interaction
2. Broad Network Access: available over the network
3. Resource Pooling: Pooled resources to support a multi-tenant model allowing multiple customers to 
   share the same applications or the same physical infrastructure
4. Rapid Elasticity: Rapidly provision and de-provision any of the cloud computing resources
5. Measured Service: Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported using metering capabilities

Four Common Cloud Deployment Models
- Public Cloud: Computing services offered by third parties provided over the public internet.
- Multi-Cloud: Group of public Clouds together. Architecture replicated over multiple cloud deployments.
      - Great for disaster prevention
      - the infrastructure of the public clouds can not be fully utilized, Google's unique features can't be replicated by AWS
- Private Cloud: architecture stored on-premise, only accessed by the business and no one else.
- Hybrid Cloud: Private cloud and Public cloud
     - Hybrid environment or Hybrid Network: on-premise infrastructure connected to a public cloud
