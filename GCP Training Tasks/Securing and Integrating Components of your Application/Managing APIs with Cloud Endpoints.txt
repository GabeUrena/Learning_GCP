Cloud Endpoints enables you to deploy and manage the API on Google Cloud
API gateways enables clients to retreve data from multiple sercices with a single request
  - Creates a layer of absteraction and insulates the clients from the details of an application that is partioned into micro services
Cloud Endpoints can be used to implement API gateways.

The APIs for your application can run on backends, such as App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, or GKE, or Compute Engine.

For legacy applications that can be moved to the cloud, impliment APIs as an adapter layer or facade. Each consumer can
  invoke these modern APIs instaeda of inoking outdated APIs using old protocols and disparate interfaces.
  - Apigee API platform, you can design, secure, analyze, and scale your APIs, all while seamlessly leveraging your legacy backends.

Cloud Endpoints provide the infrastructure support that you need to deploy and manage robust, secure, and scalable APIs
  - Interface definition
      - OpenAPI, gRPC API
  - Authentication and authorization  
      - Service-to-service authentication, User authentication
  - Management and scalability
      - Entensible Service Proxy, Service Management, Service Control
