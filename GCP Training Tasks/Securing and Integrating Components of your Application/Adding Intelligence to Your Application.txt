Google's Pretrained Machine Learning APIs
Cloud Vision API enables you to perform complex image detection.
Cloud Speech API enables developers to convert audio to text
  - It handles 101 languages and variants to support your global user base
  - You can transcribe the text of users dictating to an application's microphone, enable command and control through voice, transcribe audio files and more.
Cloud Video Intelligence API enables you to search every moment of your video file to extract and understand the video's entitles at the shot, fram and video level
  - Annotates videos stored in cloud storage and helps you identify key known entities of your video and when they occur within the video.
Cloud Translation API enables you to translate an arbitrary string into any supported language.
  - Translation API is highly responsive
  - Websites and applications can use Translation API for fast, dynamic translation of text from a source language to a target language.
Cloud Natural Language API enables you to extract information about entities such as people, places, and events that are mentioned in text documents, news articles or blog posts.
  - You can use the API to understand sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from customer conversations
  - You can also use your data to build and train your machine learning models by using TensorFlow and the Cloud AI platform

Invoke REST APIs to use machine learning APIs; no machine learning knowledge is required

Vision API can categorize objects under labels and perform optical character recognition or OCR.
