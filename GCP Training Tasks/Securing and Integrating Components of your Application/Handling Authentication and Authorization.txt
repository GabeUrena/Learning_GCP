IAM Concepts**************
Cloud IAM lets you manage access control by defining who (memebers) has what access (the role for what resource)
You can grant more granular access to Google Cloud resources using the security principle of least privilege. Only grant access to resourecs that are necessary.

Member Types:
-Google account
    - Developer, Admin or a person who interacts with Google Cloud
    - an email accociated with a google account such as gmail.com address can be an identity
-Service account
    - Belongs to an application instead of an individual and user
-Google group
    - A name collection of Google accounts and service accounts.
    - Convienient to apply an access policy to a collection of users
    - No login credentials, you cannot use them to establish ideneity to make a request to access a resource.
-Google Workspace domain
    - Represents a vitual group of all the members in an organization
    - Google Workshop customers can associate their email accounts with an internet domain name, each email account takes the form username@yourdomain.com
    - Like groups, domains cannot be used to establish identity, but they enable convenient permission management.
-Cloud Identity domain
    - Represents a virtual group of all the members in an orgiization but doesn't provide access to Google Workshop applications and features

You can grant access to users for a Google Cloud Resource
Resources:
- Google Cloud projects
- Compite Engine instances
- Cloud Storage Buckets
- Pub/sub topics

Operations allowed on resources
Permissions are represented with the following syntax:
<service>.<resource>.<verb>

Example:
pubsub.subscriptions.consume
storage.object.list
compute.disktype.list

A role is a collection of permissions.
Cloud IAM, a cloud API method requires the identity making the API request to have the appropriate permissions to use the resource.
You can grant permissions by granting roles to a user, a group, or a service account.

Kinds of roles: Basic, predefined, and custom.
- Basic roles can be applied at the project level using the Cloud Console, the API, and the G Cloud command line tool.
- Cloud IAM provides predefined roles that give granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and prevent unwanted access to other resources.
- You can grant multiple roles to the same user
- Custom roles are used when you need something even finer granted.

If you use custom roles you need to manage the permissions that make them up.
Custom roles can only be used a the project or organization levels, not at the folder level
- A policy is attached to a resource and it's used to enforce access control whenever that resource is accessed

A Cloud IAM policy is represented by the policy object
 - A policy consists of a list of bindings
 - A binding binds a list of members to a role

The Cloud IAM API methods available are: set IAM u to set policies on your resources, get IAM policy, which allows you to get a policy that was previously set and test IAM permissions,
which allows you to test whether the caller has specific permissions for a resource.
Cloud Platform resources are organized hierarchically, where the organization node is the root node in the hierarchy.
  - Projects are children of the organization, and the other resources are the children of the projects.
  - Each resource has exactly one parent.
