Cloud Storage, Datastore, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Spanner*************
Cloud Storage is a unified object storage for developers and enterprises that allow you to serve, analyze and archive data
- Objects access via HTTP requests and Object names is the only key.
There's onject meta data, but the object itself is treated as just bytes with no structure.

Firestore is a fast, fully managed, serverless, NoSQL, document database built for automatic scaling, high performance and ease of application development
- Firestore in native mode provides features such as a strong consistent storage layer, a collection and document based data model, real time upgrades and offline features and mobile and Web client libraries.
