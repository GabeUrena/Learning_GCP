Loosely Coupled Microservices and API Gateways ****** 

When building for the Cloud, Applications must be built for Global Reach, Scalability High Availability, and Security.
  - Responsive and accessible across the world
  - Handle high-traffic volumes
  - Application Architecture should Leverage the capabilities of the underlying cloud platform to scale elastically in response to changes in load.
  - Implement security best practices, depending on the use case, you might want to isolate your user data in a specific region for security and compliance.

Use Git for version control

Don't store Dependencies in the code, rather, declare your dependencies with their versions and install them using a dependency manager.
  - For instance, in a Node.js app, you can declare dependencies in a .json file and install them later using the NPM install command.

Separate configuration settings from your code.
Don't store configuration settings as constants in the source code, rather, store them as environment variables.
  - This lets you modify settings between development test and production environments.

Implement microservices in your application instead of a monolithic application.
  - Service boundaries match business boundaries
  - Codebase is modular
  - Each service can be independently updated, deployed, and scaled.
