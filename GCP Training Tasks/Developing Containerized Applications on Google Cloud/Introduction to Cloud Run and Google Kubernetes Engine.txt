Cloud Run
A managed compute platform
Runs containers on Google's infrastructure
Supports source-based deployment that builds containers for you
Build full-featured applications with other Google Cloud services

Cloud Run developer workflow
1. Code your application, it should start a server that listens for web requests
2. Build and package your application into a container image
3. Deploy the container image to Cloud Run

Cloud Run source-based workflow
1. Deploy your source code
2. Using Buildpacks, Cloud Run builds your source and pageages the application along with it's dependencies into a container image

Cloud Run supports HTTPS
- Provisions a valid TLS certification, and other configuration to support HTTPS requests.
- Handles incoming requests, decrypts, and forwards them to your applciation.

Application on Cloud Run must handle web requests
- Cloud Run epects your contiainer to listen on port number 8080 to handle web requests
    - Port 8080 is a configurable default, if this port is unabailable to your applciation, you can change the applicaiton's configuration to use a different port.
- You dont need to provide an HTTPS server, Google's infrastructure handles that for you.

Running containers
- You can develop your applications in any programming language and run them on Cloud Run, as long as they can be compiled to a 64-bit Linux binary, and packaged in a container image.
