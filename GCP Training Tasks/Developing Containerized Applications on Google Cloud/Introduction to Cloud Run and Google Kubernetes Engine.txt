Cloud Run
*A managed computing platform
Runs containers on Google's infrastructure
Supports source-based deployment that builds containers for you
Build full-featured applications with other Google Cloud services

*Cloud Run developer workflow
1. Code your application, it should start a server that listens for web requests
2. Build and package your application into a container image
3. Deploy the container image to Cloud Run

*Cloud Run source-based workflow
1. Deploy your source code
2. Using Buildpacks, Cloud Run builds your source and packages the application along with its dependencies into a container image

*Cloud Run supports HTTPS
- Provisions a valid TLS certification, and other configurations to support HTTPS requests.
- Handles incoming requests, decrypts, and forwards them to your application.

*Application on Cloud Run must handle web requests
- Cloud Run expects your container to listen on port number 8080 to handle web requests
    - Port 8080 is a configurable default, if this port is unavailable to your application, you can change the application's configuration to use a different port.
- You don't need to provide an HTTPS server, Google's infrastructure handles that for you.

*Running containers
- You can develop your applications in any programming language and run them on Cloud Run, as long as they can be compiled to a 64-bit Linux binary, and packaged in a container image.

*Pricing model
- The Cloud Run pricing model is unique, you only pay for the system resources that are used while a container is handling requests. and when it's starting or shutting.
-  Supports a pricing model that charges you for the entire container lifecycle with CPU always allocated to container instances even when there are no requests to your application.
- The price of container time increases based on the number of vCPUs and memory allocated for the container.

*Features and use cases of Cloud Run
Serving a REST API with Cloud Run
- You can use the service to provide an API, a website, or a web application.
    - If required, you can connect the service to a database to persist data handled by the API or web application.

*An e-commerce site on Cloud Run
 - Enable Cloud CDN to improve performance
 - Add Google Cloud Armor to filter malicious inbound traffic using content-based policies.
In the backend, you can connect with a relational database, a Redis store for user sessions, and connect with third-party APIs.

*Microservices on Cloud Run
- You can deploy and run an application that is composed of many microservices on Cloud Run
- Services on Cloud Run can communicate with each other using REST APIs or gRPC.
- Using Pub/Sub, you can send and receive asynchronous messages between services with guaranteed delivery. Pub/Sub is well integrated with Cloud Run using push subscriptions. Pub/Sub forwards and optionally authenticates messages as HTTP requests to the endpoint of your Cloud Run service.

*Event processing on Cloud Run
- Cloud Run integrates with various Google Cloud services such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Build, Pub/Sub, Eventarc, and others that generate events from your cloud infrastructure.

*Scheduling a Cloud Run service with Cloud Scheduler
- You can use Cloud Scheduler to securely trigger a Cloud Run service on a schedule. Cloud Scheduler is a fully managed cron job scheduler.
    - Generating invoices, rebuilding a search index
- The limitation of running a scheduled Job in the container itself is that the lifetime of a container is only guaranteed while it's handling requests. If you schedule tasks on a container to run later, the container might be shut down or stopped by the time the task has to run.

*Incremental application updates with service revisions
A common cause of service disruptions is often application updates, which affect the availability of your application.
On Cloud Run, each deployment of your container image to a service creates a new revision.
A service revision is immutable and cannot be modified. If you make a change to your application and deploy it, Cloud Run creates a new revision of your service.

A service revision consists of:
 - Your container image
 - The service configuration that includes settings such as enviornment variables, memory limits, and other configuration values.

Reduce the impact of request processing failures by splitting request traffic between the new and previous revisions of your service, by specifying the percentage of requests that should be sent to the new revision. 
  - This lets your roll back to a previous stable revision if there is a high rate of request failures, or gradually send 100% of request traffic to the new revision.

*Automatic Scaling with Cloud Run
Cloud run automatically increase the number of container instances of a service revision when necessary. This feature is known as autoscaling.

Requests to a service revision are distributed across the group of container instances.
- If all container instances are busy, Cloud Run adds additional instances.
- When demand decreases, Cloud Run stops sending traffic to some instances and shuts them down
- Note that a container instance can receive many requests at the same time with the concurrency setting, you can set the max number of requests that can be sent in parallel to a given container instance.

In addition to the rate of incoming requests to your service, the number of container instances is impacted by:
- The CPU utilization of existing instances when they are processing requests (with a target of 60% of utilization)
- The maximum concurrency setting.
- The minimum and maximum number of container instances setting

*Regions and zones
- A region consists of three or more zones. Zones and regions are logical abstractions of underlying physical resources that are provided in one or more data centers. An example of a region is us-central1 in lowa, North America.
- A zone is a deployment area of cloud resources within a region. Zones are considered to sigle failure domains within a region
- For high availability, Cloud Run distributes your containers over multiple zones in a region, making your applicaiton resilient against the failure of a zone.

*Global Load Balancing
Cloud Run integrates with the Google Cloud external HTTP(S) global load balancer (GLB), which lets you expose a single, global IP address in front of multiple, regional Cloud Run services.

The global load balancer routes requests from a client to the region closest to them. In addition to improving application availability, the GLB decreases latency for clients worldwide.

*Application portability
1. A container image contains your applciation and everything that your application needs to run.
2. Containers are inherently portable and run in any container-based enviornment.
3. The Cloud Run platform is comatible with Knative, which implements and the same container runtime contract as Cloud Run.
