Cloud Run
A managed computing platform
Runs containers on Google's infrastructure
Supports source-based deployment that builds containers for you
Build full-featured applications with other Google Cloud services

Cloud Run developer workflow
1. Code your application, it should start a server that listens for web requests
2. Build and package your application into a container image
3. Deploy the container image to Cloud Run

Cloud Run source-based workflow
1. Deploy your source code
2. Using Buildpacks, Cloud Run builds your source and packages the application along with its dependencies into a container image

Cloud Run supports HTTPS
- Provisions a valid TLS certification, and other configurations to support HTTPS requests.
- Handles incoming requests, decrypts, and forwards them to your application.

Application on Cloud Run must handle web requests
- Cloud Run expects your container to listen on port number 8080 to handle web requests
    - Port 8080 is a configurable default, if this port is unavailable to your application, you can change the application's configuration to use a different port.
- You don't need to provide an HTTPS server, Google's infrastructure handles that for you.

Running containers
- You can develop your applications in any programming language and run them on Cloud Run, as long as they can be compiled to a 64-bit Linux binary, and packaged in a container image.

Pricing model
- The Cloud Run pricing model is unique, you only pay for the system resources that are used while a container is handling requests. and when it's starting or shutting.
-  Supports a pricing model that charges you for the entire container lifecycle with CPU always allocated to container instances even when there are no requests to your application.
- The price of container time increases based on the number of vCPUs and memory allocated for the container.
