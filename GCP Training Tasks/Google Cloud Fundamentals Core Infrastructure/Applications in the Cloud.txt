Cloud Run***********
Cloud Run: is a managed compute platform that runs stateless containers via web requests or Hub sub-events
  - Serverless
  - Fast
Removes all infrastructure management tasks so you can focus on developing applications
  -Built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment built on Kubernetes.
 It can be fully managed on Google Cloud, on Google Kubernetes Engine, or anywhere Knative runs
Automatically scales up and down from zero almost instantaneously. It charges only for the resources used calculated down to the nearest 100 milliseconds
Cloud Run step process:
1. Write your code: This application should start a server that listens for web requests
2. You build and package your application into a container image.
3. The container image is pushed to the artifact registry, where Cloud Run will deploy it.
  - You will get a unique HTTPS URL back when you deploy your container image.
  - Cloud Run starts your containers on demand to handle requests and ensures that all incoming requests are handled by dynamically adding and removing containers.

For some use cases, a container-based workflow is great because it gives you a great amount of transparency and flexibility.

Cloud Run lets you turn source code into an HTTPS endpoint and lets your bender make sure your container image is secured, well-configured, and built consistently.
  - You can use a container workflow as well as a Source-based workflow.
The source-based approach will deploy source code instead of a container image
Cloud run then builds the source and packages the application into a container image
  - It does this using Buildpacks an open-source project
Cloud Run handles HTTPS serving for you.
  - You worry about handling web requests and Cloud run handles adding the encryption.

Cost:
Pay for the system resources you use while a container is handling requests with a granularity of 100 milliseconds.
  - Small fee for every one million requests you serve.
  - Price of container time increases with CPU and Memory 
  - Can run any binary as long as it's compiled for Linux 64-bit
Cloud Run can run web apps written using Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, Go, C++
  - Also in Cobol, Haskell, and Perl
  - as long as your app handles web requests.

Development in the cloud *******************
Example: Applications have multiple functions, for instance, let users upload images. Those images might need to be processed in different ways like converting to a standard format,
         a thumbnail into a different size, and storing each new file in a repository.
Cloud Functions, you write a single-purpose function that completes the necessary image manipulations and then arranges for it to automatically run whenever a new image is uploaded.
Cloud Function is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous computing solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events without the need to 
    manage a server or a runtime environment. These functions can be used to construct application workflows from individual business logic tasks.

Cloud Functions can connect and extend Cloud Services your build to the nearest 100 milliseconds, but only while your code is running.

Cloud Functions supports writing source code in many programming languages.
  - Node, JS, Python, Go, Java, Net Core, Ruby and PHP.

Events from Cloud Storage and PubSub can trigger Cloud Functions asynchronously or you can use HTTP invocation for synchronous execution.
