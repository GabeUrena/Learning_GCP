Google Cloud storage options ************

Google Cloud has options for Structured, Unstructured, Transactional, and Relational Data.

Storage Cloud Storage Products:
1. Cloud Storage
2. CloudSQL
3. Cloud Spanner
4. Firestore
5. Cloud Bigtable

Object Storage: A computer data storage architecture that manages data as "objects" and not as
                a file (file storage) and folder hierarchy or chunks of a disk block storage

    - Stored in a packaged format which contains the binary form of the actual data itself. As well 
      as relevant associated meta-data (date created, author, resources type, and permissions) and a globally unique
Google's cloud storage is Object Storage.
    - primary use is when Binary Large-Object storage is needed for online content, backups, and archived data
      and for storage of intermediate results in processing workflows.

Cloud Storage files are organized into buckets
Buckets 
  - Globally unique name and specific geographic location where it
    should be stored and an ideal location for a bucket is where latency is minimized

Cloud SQL********
MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL server services.
  - no download, scales up to 64 processor cores and 400+ GB RAM with 30 TB of storage, Supports automatic replication 
    scenarios, Supports managed backups, cost of an instance covers 7 backups, Encrypts customer data when Google's internal 
    network and when stored in database tables, temporary files, and backups, Includes a network firewall.
Benefit - Accessible by Google Cloud services and external services
  - Cloud SQL can be used with App Engine using standard drivers like J for Java or MySQL DB for Python
  - Compute Engine instances can be authorized to access Cloud SQL instances and configure the Cloud SQL instance to be in 
    the same zone as your virtual machine.
  - Cloud SQL also supports other applications and tools that you might use like SQL workbench, Toad, and other external          applications using standard MySQL drivers.

Cloud Spanner*******
Cloud Spanner is a fully managed relational database service that scales horizontally, is strongly consistent, and speaks SQL.
  - SQL relatable database management system with joins and secondary indexes
  - Built-in high-availability
  - Strong global consistency
  - High numbers of input/output operations per second (10,000+ reads and writes a sec)

Firestore ***********
  - Flexible
  - Horizontally scalable
  - NoSQL cloud database
Firestore, data is stored in documents and then organized into collections
Documents can contain complex nested objects in addition to subcollections
  - Firestore's NoSql queries can be then used to retrieve individual-specific documents or retrieve all the documents in a collection that match your query parameters. 
  - Queries, can include multiple, chained filters and combine filtering and sorting options, there also indexed by default so query performance is proportional to the size of the result set, not the dataset.
  - Firestore uses data synchronization to update data on any connected device, making simple one-time fetch queries efficient.
    - It caches data that an app is actively using, so the app can write, read, listen to, and query data even if 
      the device is offline.
Firestore leverages Google Cloud's powerful infrastructure: automatic multi-region data replication, strong consistency guarantees, atomic batch operations, and real transaction support.
COST - Firestore charges you for reading, writing, and deleting documents, Queries, which are counted as one document read, the amount of database storage used, and the amount of network bandwidth used.
  - Ingress is free and 10GiB of free network egress per month.

Cloud Bigtable ************
  - Google's NoSQL Big data database service. The same database that powers search, analytics, maps, and Gmail.
  - Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistently low latency and high throughput.
  - So it's a great choice for both operational and analytical applications including the Internet of Things, user 
    analytics, and financial data analysis.
Customers pick Bigtable if:
  - They work with more than 1TB of semi-structured or structured data
  - Data is fast with high throughput, or it's rapidly changing
  - They work with NoSQL data
  - They work with big data, running asynchronous batch or synchronous real-time processing on the data
  - They run machine learning algorithms on the data
Cloud Bigtable can interact with third-party clients and other Google Cloud services.
  - Using APIs data can be read from and written to Cloud BigTable through a data science layer Managed VMs, the HBase REST server, or a Java server using the HBase client
      - This is typically used to server data to applications, dashboards, and data services.
  - Data can be streamed through frameworks like data flow streaming, spark streaming, and storm
     - If streaming isn't an option, data can be read from and written to Cloud Bigtable through batch processes like Hadoop MapReduce, Dataflow, or Spark.
