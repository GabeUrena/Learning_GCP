Virtual Machines and Networks in the Cloud******************
VPC: a secure, individual, private cloud computing model hosted remotely on public cloud
  - Google VPC networks are global and can have subnets in any Google Cloud region worldwide
  - VPC neworks connect Google Cloud resources to each other and to the internet
    - size of subnet can be increased by expanding the range of ip addresses assigned to it.
Compute Engine
  - Can create and run virtual machines on Googles infastructure.
  - Can be configured much like a physical server
  - Doesn't require a particular option or machine type to get high throughput between processing and persistent disks
  - You can choose your machine properties using a set of predefined or custom machine types.

Compute Engine has Autoscaling
This lets you automatically adjust to the work load. 

Virtual machine
  - Can be created throught the GC Console, the GC CLU, or the Compute Engine API
  - Can run different OS

VPC features
Routing Tables - built in, no router provisioning or managing needed
Firewall - provided and don't need to be managed, Rules can be defined through network tags

"what if your company has several Google Cloud projects, and the VPCs need to talk to each other?"
Use VPC peering to establish a relationship between two VPCs to exchange traffic. Alternatively you can have a project utilize another VPC by configuring the VPC as a Shared VPC

Cloud Load Balancing: By spreading the load, load balancing reduces the risk that applications experience performance issues.
 - A fully distributed, software-defined managed service for all your traffic

Global HTTP(S) if you need to cross reginak load balancung for a web application
Global SSL Proxy for secure sockets layer traffic that's not HTTP, use the global SSL proxy load balancer.
Global TCP Proxy for other TCP traffic that odesn't use SSL
Regional if you want to load balance UDP traffic or traffic on any port number
Reginal Internal When you want to load balance traffic inside your project, for instance, between presentation layer and   
                 the business layer of your application
Internal HTTP(S) managed service based on the open Source Envoy proxy. Run and scale services hehind an internal load balancing IP address.

Cloud DNS: Managed DNS Service that runs on the same infrastructure as Google.
  - Low latency, high availability, and cost-effective.
  - The DNS informatin you publish is served from redundant locations around the world
  - Cloud DNS is programmable. you can publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records using the Google Cloud console, command Line interface or the API

edge caching: Use of caching servers to store content closer to end users
  - You can use this system to accelerate content delivery in your application by using Cloud CDN (Content Delivery Network)
  - Customers will experience lower latency, reduced load, and you save money.

After HTTP(s) load balancing is set up you can enable Cloud CDN with a check box.

 Connecting netwrks to Google VPC
1. Start with Vitual Private Network connection over the internet and use IPsec VPN protocol to create a "tunnel" connection.
  - to make the connection dynamic you use Cloud Router
    - Cloud Router lets other networks and Google VPC, exchange route info over the VPN using the Border Gateway Protocol
  - If you were to add a subnet to your Google VPC, your on-premises network will automatically get routes to it.

2. Direct Peering
  - putting a router in the same public data center as a Google point of presence and using it to echange traffic between networks

3. Carrier Peering
  - Gives direct access from an on-premises network through a service provider's network
  - not covered by google service level agreement
4. Dedicated Interconnect
  - Allows for one or more direct, private, connections to google
  - If these connections have topologies that meet Google's specifications, they can be covered by an SLA of up to 99.99%
  - These connections can be backed up by a VPN for greater reliability
5. Partner Interconnect
  - Great for when a data center is in a physical location that can't reach a Dedicated Interconnect colocation facility, 
    or if the data needs don't warrent an entire 10 GigaBytre per second connection.
  - Can be configured to support mission-critical services and applications that can tolerate some downtime
  - Can be covered by up to a 99.99% SLA
