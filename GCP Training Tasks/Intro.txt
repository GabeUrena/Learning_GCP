Google Cloud Offerings Categories:

Compute, Storage, Big Data, Machine Learning, Application Services.

Cloud
- Customers get computing resources that are on demand and self-service
- Customers get access to those resources over the Internet, from anywhere
- The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pile
- Resources are elastic which means they are flexible so customers can be
- Customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go.

Infrastructure as a service LaaS:
- Provides raw computer, storage, and network capability virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers
Platform as a service PaaS:
- bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure that the application needs.

Serverless technology:
Let you focus on coding rather than server configurations.
- Cloud functions (Manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service) and Cloud run (allows customers to deploy their containerized microservices-based application, in a fully managed environment.)

Software as a service SaaS:
Software stored online.
